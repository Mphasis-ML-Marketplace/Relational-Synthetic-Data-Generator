The solution generates tabular synthetic data for a dataset of maximum two tables with parent and child relationship. Thus generated synthetic dataset can be used for downstream tasks like analytics, system testing etc. or act as a supplement dataset to develop further analytics or ML models. The solution also provides statistical and privacy metrics to evaluate the synthetic data generated. Statistical evaluation of synthetic data is perforrmed using Chi-square (CS) test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. CS test and KS test are statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether a variable is likely to come from a specified distribution or not.
